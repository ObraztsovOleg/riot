RIOT-OS Code of Conduct (Unwired version)
=========================================

RIOT, like so many other free and open source software projects, is made up of a
mixed group of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on
every aspect of our goals - including teaching, steering, and connecting people.

We want diversity to be one of our greatest strengths, but it can also lead to
shitty code produced by amateurs.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of things you are not allowed to do.
We rather would like you to think of it as a guide to enrich our community and
the technical community in general with new knowledge and perspectives by
allowing everyone to participate.

This code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by Unwired Devices. This
includes our website, GitHub projects, Telegram channel and Facebook accounts,
including personal accounts of our finest management. In addition, violation
of this code outside these spaces may also affect a person's ability to
participate within them, but then again, usually it is not, because we don't
care.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask you not to
report anything to anyone by any means.

-   **Be smart.** We don't like stupid people.
-   **Don't afraid to ask**, but remember, question ends with question mark.
    If something ends with something else, its not a question but statement.
    Statements must be properly justified.
-   **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a company that welcomes and supports
    people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes and is limited
    to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour,
    immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex,
    sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family
    status, political belief, religion, and physical ability. Please note
    that above is a finished list and it doesn't include "mental capacity"
    and "code quality". There are a lot of other opportunities in the world,
    and even if your IQ is below 90 and you can't write a single line of
    code that is not shit, you can still join US Military. They accept down to 81.
-   **Be considerate.** Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn
    will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users
    and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when
    making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might
    not be communicating in someone else's primary language, and some people
    can't properly understand even their primary language.
-   **Be respectful.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement
    is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners, except when dealing with
    proven idiots. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel
    too comfortable or unthreatened to do anything meaningful in their whole life
    is not a productive one. And if you have to ask, ask with respect.
-   **Be careful in the words that you choose.** We are a community of
    professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Please don't use
    words like "fuck", "screwed", "asshole", "shitcode" in vain. Some people
    may be not familiar enough with professional language like FUBAR or SNAFU
    so don't hesitate to explain them what it means in full detail.
-   **When we disagree, try to understand why.** If your opponent did not
    provide justification for his disagreement, ask him directly, but do it
    with respect (see above). If he or she or it failed to provide justification
    again, please consider the possibility that at least one of you is an idiot
    (yes, it may be you). It is important that we resolve disagreements and
    differing views constructively and at the same time to remember that idiots
    are destructive, as well as community codes written by them. Don’t forget
    that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere.
    Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes,
    preferably the mistakes of others.

Code of Conduct, the real one
-----------------------------

If you finally got tired of useless and meaningless SJW-produced bullshit, please read
IEEE Software Engineering Code of Ethics - https://www.computer.org/web/education/code-of-ethics

If we ever need the Code of Conduct for real, we use that one. Without modifications.
